## What is it?

This package turns bibtex-completion functions into completing-read-based Emacs commands. 
When used with selectrum, embark, and marginalia, it provides similar functionality to helm-bibtex and ivy-bibtex: quick filtering and selecting of bibliographic entries from the minibuffer, and the option to run different commands against them.

Here's a screenshot with selectrum and embark.

## Installation

The easiest way to install ATM is via straight, like so:

``` emacs-lisp
(straight-use-package
 '(bibtex-actions :host github :repo "bdarcus/bibtex-actions"))
 ```

If you happen to be using Doom Emacs, you can just add this to your `package.el` file:

``` emacs-lisp
(package! bibtex-actions 
  :recipe (:host github :repo "bdarcus/bibtex-actions"))
```

## Configuration

### Basic

Since all of the command logic resides in bibtex-completion, that is where to look for different [configuration options][bt-config]. 

The only thing, however, that you _must_ configure is where to find your bib file(s). 

``` emacs-lisp
(setq bibtex-completion-bibliography "~/bib/references.bib")
```

To access these commands from `embark-act`, set this variable.

``` emacs-lisp
(setf (alist-get 'bibtex embark-keymap-alist) 'bibtex-actions-map)
```

### Rich UI

There are three sections of the browsing UI. 

1. The prefix, exploiting the affixation feature only available starting with Emacs 28, and holding the symbols to indicate the presence of PDFs or notes associated with the entries.
2. The main display, which by default shows author, title, and date.
3. The suffix, which by default shows citekey, reference type, and (if present) tags or keywords.

You can search against all of the above content. 
For the prefix, you can filter for associated PDFs or notes using `has:pdf` or `has:note` respectively (and at least with my setup, even the `:p` or `:n` shorthand).

You can configure both of the last two just as you do with bibtex-completion.

``` emacs-lisp
(setq bibtex-actions-display-template '((t . " ${title=:*}")))
(setq bibtex-actions-display-template-suffix '((t . "          ${=key=:15}")))
```

By default, this UI is plain text, but you can configure it to use icons instead.

Here's how to configure it to use `all-the-icons`:

``` emacs-lisp
(setq bibtex-actions-symbols
  `((pdf . (,(all-the-icons-icon-for-file "foo.pdf" :face 'all-the-icons-dred) .
            ,(all-the-icons-icon-for-file "foo.pdf" :face 'bibtex-actions-icon-dim)))
    (note . (,(all-the-icons-icon-for-file "foo.txt") .
            ,(all-the-icons-icon-for-file "foo.txt" :face 'bibtex-actions-icon-dim)))        
    (link . 
        (,(all-the-icons-faicon "external-link-square" :v-adjust 0.02 :face 'all-the-icons-dpurple) .
        ,(all-the-icons-faicon "external-link-square" :v-adjust 0.02 :face 'bibtex-actions-icon-dim)))))
;; Here we define a face to dim non 'active' icons, but preserve alignment
(defface bibtex-actions-icon-dim
    '((((background dark)) :foreground "#282c34")
     (((background light)) :foreground "#fafafa"))
     "Face for obscuring/dimming icons"
     :group 'all-the-icons-faces)
```

## Usage

You have a few different ways to interact with these commands.

### `M-x`

Simply do `M-x` and select the command that you want, enter the terms to find the item you are looking for, and hit return. 
This runs the default action: the command you invoked.

Here's the view, using marginalia for annotations.

A note on multiple candidate selection:

These commands do allow you to select multiple items, with two caveats:

1. For this to work correctly, you _must_ use the ampersand (`&`) as `crm-separator` to separate the candidates.
2. We use very long candidate strings, so if you use a completion system that requires you to `TAB`-complete, the experience is less-than-ideal.

### Access an alternate action via `embark-act`

If while browsing you instead would rather edit that record, and you have embark installed and configured, this is where `embark-act` comes in. 
Simply input the keybinding for `embark-act` (in my case `C-o`), and select the alternate action.

### Use `embark-collect-snapshot`

A final option, that can be very useful: run `embark-collect-snapshot` (`S`) from `embark-act`. 
This will select the candidate subset, and open it in a separate buffer. 
From there, you can run the same options discussed above using `embark-act` (which is also bound to `a` in the collect buffer).

So, for example, say you are working on a paper. 
You hold the complete superset of items you are interested in citing at some point in that buffer. 
From there, you can run different actions on the candidates at will, rather than search individually for each item you want to cite.

## Comparisons

This is inspired by `helm-bibtex` and `ivy-bibtex`, but is based on `completing-read`. In comparison:


- like `helm-bibtex`, but unlike `ivy-bibtex`, `bibtex-actions` has support for multi-selection of candidates
- `helm-bibtex` and `ivy-bibtex` provide a single command, and the actions are accessed from there; `bibtex-actions` provides all of its actions as standard commands, available from `M-x`, without a single entry point.
- `bibtex-actions` is based on `completing-read-multiple`, with a single dependency, and works with different completion systems (though in practice is best supported in `selectrum`) and supporting packages that are `completing-read` compliant; `helm-bibtex` and `ivy-bibtex` are based on `helm` and `ivy` respectively
